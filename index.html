		<p>In 1975 people left their homes unlocked, their keys in the ignition when they parked up town, and importantly when you passed someone on the road you waved.</p> 
		<p>There were no B &amp; Bâ€™s and no motels.  In the evenings and on weekends if you came across someone, you knew that they either lived here or were visiting someone who did.</p>
		<p>Everybody waved because you knew that the person you were passing was a neighbor or at the least a fellow Islander, temporary or permanent. There is an energy that passes between people when you wave. You see each other.  You are joined at the hip in a way. That gets us through tough times, enlivens our souls, and makes us extended family.</p>
		<p>Vashon Island is encircled by Waves from the ocean, blanketed by radio Waves from Voice of Vashon, so it is natural that we Wave.</p> 
		<p>If we stop waving to each other we will lose our sense of community.</p>
